At the center of this transformation is Pointerra3D, a cloud-native digital twin platform designed to unify lidar, imagery, BIM/CAD, and GIS datasets into a single, ultra-fast browser-based environment capable of scaling from individual assets to entire service territories. By eliminating traditional workflow bottlenecks and enabling enterprise-wide insights, Pointerra3D delivers measurable improvements in safety, reliability, and operational efficiency. Proven Outcomes at Utility Scale Leading US utilities rely on Pointerra3D to accelerate key programs and derive greater value from their geospatial data. A major US utility demonstrates the platform\u2019s impact across storm response, grid hardening, and backlog reduction: \u2022 Storm Response: Automated damage assessments using post-event lidar enabled rapid, feeder-level reporting and dispatched field crews 60% faster than traditional methods. \u2022 Grid Hardening: Automated pole loading analysis reduced engineering time from 20 minutes per pole to 2 minutes, enabling analysis of more than 65,000 poles to guide hardening and resilience initiatives. \u2022 Backlog Elimination: Systematic analysis of 600,000+ poles uncovered 66,000 double poles and 9,000 with remaining third-party attachments, compressing what would have been a multi-year remediation program into just six months. These results highlight Pointerra3D\u2019s unmatched ability to process massive datasets in the cloud while producing actionable intelligence that directly improves operational outcomes. Utility-Specific Applications Pointerra3D supports a broad range of mission-critical utility programs: Vegetation Management The platform\u2019s vegetation analytics automate encroachment detection, tree classification, and growth modeling across transmission and distribution networks. Individual tree segmentation and predictive growth analysis enable utilities to optimize trimming cycles, reduce vegetation-related outages, and improve regulatory compliance. Poles & Wires Analytics Pointerra3D automatically extracts detailed asset attributes such as pole dimensions, conductor sag, attachment points, clearances and flags potential violations. Automated pole loading supports large-scale grid hardening efforts, and accelerates engineering to enhance system integrity and third-party oversight. Storm Response & Resilience During extreme weather events, utilities can rapidly assess damage using post-storm aerial lidar or imagery. Pointerra3D enables immediate triage, resource coordination, and restoration planning. Historical data supports trend analyses and predictive models that identify assets most vulnerable to future events. Asset Inspection & Compliance Virtual inspections powered by digital twins can reduce field labor by 60\u201370%. Automated conformance checks verify construction against engineering design, while condition assessments and heat maps help prioritize high-risk assets and streamline maintenance scheduling. Enterprise Integration & Scalability Pointerra3D integrates seamlessly into existing enterprise ecosystems via REST APIs, supporting platforms such as Esri ArcGIS, Maximo, SAP, and other utility systems of record. Its Master Model capability ensures that digital twins remain dynamic, continuously updated, and historically contextualized as new survey data is ingested. The platform\u2019s cloud-native architecture removes traditional constraints associated with desktop-bound GIS and CAD tools. Pointerra processes statewide lidar programs in hours, not weeks, while handling complex coordinate systems and projection environments common in utility operations. Secure, two-factor authenticated share links simplify collaboration with contractors, partners, and regulators. Competitive Differentiation Traditional utility workflows rely on a patchwork of desktop software, slow data transfers, and disconnected systems. Pointerra3D stands apart by offering: \u2022 Immediate Access: A browser-based environment with no installations or IT rollout \u2022 Universal Data Support: Side-by-side streaming of lidar, imagery, BIM/CAD, 3D meshes, GIS vectors, and GPS-based video \u2022 Enterprise-Scale Performance: Cloud compute that effortlessly handles utility-wide datasets \u2022 Real-Time Collaboration: All stakeholders\u2014internal or external\u2014working from the same live dataset This unified approach eliminates versioning issues, accelerates project cycles, and reduces IT overhead.

Peek ADMS Diagram transforms utility operations by granting control room visibility to every field crew, engineer, and corporate user who needs it. Unlike legacy systems that lock network data to expensive workstation licenses, Peek delivers live ADMS diagrams to any device\u2014desktop, tablet, or mobile\u2014 and works offline when connectivity fails. What makes Peek different? Precision Operations: Our Clients have mitigated switching errors and wrong equipment incidents. Peek's real-time view of the network diagrams with unified asset identification allows technicians to confirm exact pole numbers and equipment locations with your control room, ensuring accurate switching procedures every time. Works in Dead Zones: Field crews operating in rural areas or disaster zones maintain full network diagram access even with zero signal coverage. When infrastructure fails and connectivity disappears, Peek maintains uninterrupted access to network data. Strategic Alignment: Field crews and control room see identical network diagrams in real-time. No more radio calls asking 'what do you see?' - everyone works from the same information. Enhanced with Peek Field: Stop juggling multiple systems. Execute switching operations, manage incidents, and coordinate with control rooms directly from your network diagrams - eliminating paperwork and radio delays. Tested across diverse environments - from remote rural territories to dense urban networks - Peek delivers unwavering performance in every operating environment. See live Peek demonstrations at DistribuTech 2026 - visit us at Booth L952 next to Ballroom 20A on the upper level to experience how we're extending network visibility beyond the control room.

From the beginning of our secure product development, all of our internal critical security componentry continues to be sourced from trusted companies from all over the world, originating from countries that remain in good standing with the United States. Since we began in 1983, dozens of award-winning innovations have been developed under the Apricorn brand as well as for a number of leading computer manufacturers on an OEM basis. Apricorn\u2019s unique approach to employing 256-bit internal and portable encryption is particularly valuable for verticals whose data security practices are regulated (e.g., finance, healthcare, education, and insurance.) And for federal, state, and local governments, Apricorn's encrypted USB drives and devices set the standard for data security for both North America and the rest of the world. Since every Apricorn Aegis drive is encrypted and authenticated exclusively by way of its own onboard keypad and internal hardware, there is never any software involvement in these critical security parameters. As such, Apricorn device CSPs are never shared with that device's host computer.

Our services are built around how utilities actually use data\u2014prioritizing clarity, defensibility, and real operational value rather than experimental technology. Aerial Inspection Services include distribution, transmission, and substation inspections using high-resolution RGB and thermal imagery. Big Sky performs component-level inspection of poles, conductors, hardware, insulators, transformers, and substation equipment, with thermal collections timed for peak or seasonal load conditions to identify overheating and performance issues. All inspection results are reviewed by experienced analysts, certified linemen, and thermographers, with issues classified and ranked to align with utility maintenance workflows. Inspection data is fully GIS-integrated and delivered through major mapping systems and the INSPECTR platform. LiDAR & Corridor Mapping services provide high-accuracy LiDAR data for transmission and distribution systems. Deliverables support clearance analysis, vegetation encroachment modeling, and engineering workflows, including PLS-CADD-ready point clouds for compliance and design. These datasets are well-suited for line rebuilds, reconductoring projects, and capacity upgrade planning, and are repeatable to support change detection and long-term asset management. Vegetation & Wildfire Risk Analysis helps utilities identify and prioritize right-of-way vegetation concerns while integrating terrain and wildfire risk factors. These analyses support defensible wildfire mitigation planning and risk-based maintenance decisions. Clear, actionable mapping products are delivered to guide field crews and vegetation contractors efficiently and safely. Substation & Facility Modeling combines aerial and terrestrial data capture to produce accurate 3D models of substations and utility facilities. These models provide reliable existing-conditions documentation to support planning, upgrades, and expansions, while reducing site visits and improving coordination across engineering, operations, and management teams. INSPECTR \u2013 Inspection Visualization & Action Platform provides a web-based, map-centered environment for reviewing inspection imagery and findings. INSPECTR centralizes large volumes of RGB, thermal, and inspection data, applies dynamic severity rankings for prioritization, and allows inspection results to be layered with operational context such as wildfire risk, outage history, and load. The platform also tracks repair actions, mitigations, and resolution status, creating a clear system of record that supports audits, regulatory compliance, and defensible decision-making. Storm Response & Rapid Assessment services enable rapid deployment following storm events to support damage assessment and line patrols. Aerial identification of downed vegetation and damaged assets allows utilities to receive maps and imagery quickly, improving restoration planning, crew efficiency, and field safety during emergency response. Utility-Focused Operations are built around safety-first, utility-approved sUAS workflows and experience supporting electric cooperatives, municipal utilities, and investor-owned utilities. All deliverables are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing utility systems and processes, with an emphasis on practical, dependable solutions that utilities can rely on today.

We partner with investor-owned electric and gas utilities to plan, manage, and deliver complex capital infrastructure, including transmission, distribution, grid modernization, energy efficiency, data centers, and nuclear generation. We are a pure-play power firm. We do not operate outside the power sector. Power is all we do. That focus means our teams speak the language of utility operations, understand regulatory and rate case dynamics, and know how to navigate the organizational complexity that comes with large capital programs. Today, we manage over $1 billion in active utility capital programs nationwide, with nearly all of our work performed under prime contracts directly with utilities. Utilities hire us to own outcomes. Our clients include some of the largest investor-owned utilities in the country, and they bring us in when predictability, governance, and delivery certainty matter most. Our services span three areas: Program Management. We provide program and project delivery, PMO leadership, project controls, portfolio planning, and regulatory readiness support, including management of energy efficiency portfolios. Our teams embed with utility organizations to drive accountability, identify risk early, and keep programs on schedule and on budget. Field Services. We put boots on the ground through construction oversight, quality assurance, safety, and contractor management. We maintain a physical presence alongside clients and their contractors to ensure what gets planned actually gets built. Digital & Analytics. We design and deploy reporting systems, program performance dashboards, and operational tools that give utility leaders real-time visibility into cost, schedule, safety, and productivity. Our approach is practical: technology in service of better decisions, not technology for its own sake. What sets CARIAN apart is the combination of advisory rigor and an execution and delivery mindset. We do not hand over a strategy deck and walk away. We stay through delivery, operating as an extension of our clients\u2019 teams with low-noise communication and a bias toward getting things done. CARIAN is headquartered in New Jersey, with teams embedded at client sites across the country.

As energy systems become more digital, interconnected, and regulated, Centrii helps operators move beyond fragmented security tools toward a unified, risk-driven approach to OT cyber resilience. At the core of our offering is Centrii Portal, Centrii\u2019s OT cybersecurity platform designed specifically for energy and industrial environments. Centrii provides deep visibility into OT assets, communications, and vulnerabilities - without disrupting critical operations. Built with the realities of energy OT in mind, the platform supports legacy systems, modern control architectures, and hybrid IT/OT environments across generation, transmission, distribution, and renewables. Centrii Portal goes beyond traditional monitoring by delivering regulatory compliance, actionable threat intelligence, and financial risk insight in a single platform. Energy operators can continuously assess and demonstrate compliance with key regulations and standards such as NERC CIP, IEC 62443, and regional regulatory frameworks. Compliance data is automatically mapped to operational environments, reducing audit burden while increasing confidence with regulators and stakeholders. The Centrii portal also equips organizations with OT-focused threat intelligence that is relevant, contextual, and operationally actionable. This intelligence-driven approach helps security and operations teams move from reactive defense to proactive risk management. What truly sets Centrii apart is our focus on financial risk quantification for OT cyber threats. Centrii Portal translates technical cyber risks into clear business and financial impact -such as potential downtime, safety implications, regulatory penalties, and revenue loss. This enables executives, boards, and risk leaders to make informed investment decisions, align cybersecurity with enterprise risk management, and communicate cyber risk in business terms.

I lead U.S. strategy and commercial execution for Cyber Energia, aligning OT resilience with the financial, operational, and regulatory demands shaping renewable energy, BESS, microgrids, and data-center power.  My focus is direct: Reduce risk. Protect availability. Strengthen bankability. Drive adoption.  Operators are expanding portfolios while navigating regulatory pressure, insurer scrutiny, and increasingly frequent OT-targeted attacks. Most teams still lack unified visibility, have uncontrolled vendor access, and struggle to quantify downtime in financial terms.  That\u2019s where I operate.  My background spans SaaS, cybersecurity, energy intelligence, and capital markets. I work with asset managers, operators, OT/ICS engineers, CISOs, and compliance leaders to turn operational exposure into clear business impact \u2014 and to accelerate the adoption of the technologies that harden critical infrastructure.  If you\u2019re shaping the next generation of energy or data-center power, let\u2019s connect.

Why it matters : Scalable & flexible: Built to pair with busbar trunking and switchgear for quick reconfiguration and tap-offs as loads grow. Efficient: High-conductivity Cu options minimize I\u00b2R losses/voltage drop; Al variants meet ampacity at lower weight and cost. Reliable: Silvered interfaces and insulated assemblies support predictable temperature performance and short-circuit withstand when designed into compliant systems. Core products & options: Rigid, insulated bus bars (Cu/Al): precision-machined sized for high current in tight footprints. Integrated silver contact fabrications and plating: silver for ultra-low milliohm contact resistance and heat shedding; tin for durable, cost-effective bolted connections. Value add: punched patterns, studs/PEMs, insulation/over-molding, and labeling, How we help design teams: Checon collaborates on metal selection (Cu/Al), thickness, silver contact integration, joint design, and plating plan. We tune geometry for temperature rise, magnetic forces, creepage/clearance, and torque, then prototype quickly. Our vertically integrated North American facilities handle machining, contact assembly fabrication, precision plating, and finishing for consistent quality and dependable lead times. Copper vs. Aluminum: Copper: best for peak current density, tight voltage-drop budgets, maximum thermal headroom. Aluminum: best for weight/cost advantages\u2014engineered cross-sections achieve required ampacity. In both cases, silver at contact points reduces resistance and heat; tin protects broad joint areas. Where this fits: Utilities/industry: substations, switchgear, reclosers, motor control, and high-cycle DC links. Let\u2019s build your next system. Bring your drawings or duty cycle to Booth UL239 to review samples, plating options, and case studies\u2014or book a design review with Checon's Applications Engineering and Product Sales group.

However, our version costs about 70% to 85% less and can be deployed roughly 3 to 4 times faster. Building on a Foundation: Enline's approach centers on creating a mirror-image 3D Digital Twin Replica of the target asset, coupled with the minimum number of physical sensors needed to continuously verify the >95% accuracy of our system. Once created by our team, this digital twin enables rapid addition of additional beneficial offerings, such as our Network State Estimation (NSE), which can significantly boost the operational resilience of the connected system. ABB's Choice: Enline's platform has been chosen as ABB's strategic partner to provide Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) and Network State Estimation (NSE) to its Advanced Energy Management System (AEMS) clientele worldwide. It's not \"Us or Them\": If a client wants to use a traditional \"Sensor-Heavy\" DLR on their \"Congestion-Plagued\" flagship transmission lines, we completely understand. However, if they seek an elegant, proven, cost-effective, and much less labor-intensive way to 1) optimize achievable capacity by more than 20%, 2) significantly reduce unnecessary operational expenses, and 3) easily improve their real-time monitoring capabilities across a much broader portion of their transmission portfolio, then they really should know about us.

About Forsite Consultants Product Categories Energy Trading/ Energy Markets > Risk Management Transmission > Vegetation Management/Wildfire Mitigation Contact Us  John Davies  Manager - Wildland Fire  John is a Registered Professional Forester with the Association of B.C. Forest Professionals with over 30 years of wildland fire management experience. He has a solid foundation in wildfire management and fire ecology and applies his operational fire knowledge to all aspects of his work. His interests are wildland fire and fuel management, prescribed burning, community interface protection, the rehabilitation of sensitive ecosystems. He is passionate about working with First Nations to build capacity within their membership with regards to wildland fire and burning, communities to develop responsibly following FireSmart guidelines, and with forest licensees to integrate fire back into forest management.   John started community protection and wildfire management work in 2004 as one of only a few professional foresters in BC that had extensive practical operational experience in wildfire suppression, fuel management operations, and prescribed burning. He has developed this extensive knowledge of the ecological role of fire, fire behaviour, how fuel conditions affect wildfire behaviour, and of tactical strategies required to protect communities and other values. This knowledge is a result of hundreds of hours fighting forest fires, and countless hours prescribing, implementing and monitoring fuel management and prescribed burning projects during his 30-year career in wildfire management.

Fugro is leading the way with advanced geo-data solutions that transform how utilities manage transmission and distribution networks. At the core of this transformation are two powerful technologies: Lidar and Imagery. Lidar is a cornerstone of Fugro\u2019s asset management strategy. Through high-resolution aerial and ground-based Lidar scanning, we capture and create 3D models of transmission corridors, substations, and surrounding environments. This data provides utilities with unparalleled visibility into their networks, enabling them to identify vegetation encroachment, assess structural integrity, and detect potential hazards before they escalate. Lidar\u2019s accuracy supports optimized maintenance planning, reduces operational risk, and ensures compliance with stringent regulatory requirements\u2014all while minimizing environmental impact. Building on this foundation, Fugro\u2019s ROAMES (Remote Observation, Automated Modeling, and Engineering System) platform revolutionizes network management by converting Lidar and imagery data into a dynamic digital twin of the entire asset network. This virtual environment allows utilities to visualize assets in real time, simulate scenarios, and apply predictive analytics for proactive decision-making. With ROAMES, utilities can forecast asset performance, prioritize maintenance, and respond quickly to emerging threats such as storm damage or wildfire risk\u2014without relying solely on costly field inspections.

For 40 years, we\u2019ve taken a deliberately uncompromising approach to meteorological and environmental measurement. No fragile parts. No inflated promises. No performance that only works on paper. Our ultrasonic anemometers and weather stations are engineered for operators who need accurate data they can stake decisions on - the kind of decisions that move markets, protect assets or keep operations running when conditions turn hostile. We sit at the heart of some of the world\u2019s most demanding operations: stabilising power grids, supporting dynamic line rating, guiding renewable assets, informing aviation decisions, and powering smart-city intelligence. If you\u2019re working in a sector where the environment dictates performance, chances are you\u2019re already using Gill, directly or indirectly. We\u2019re not in the business of \u201cnice-to-have\u201d sensors. We build the kit operators rely on when accuracy, durability and trust genuinely matter. Why Gill Instruments Meteorological sensors provide utilities real-time insight into the environmental conditions that influence grid performance and risk. They can track factors such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation and precipitation, which directly affect the thermal capacity of transmission lines. This data can support proactive decisions allowing operators adjust line ratings, anticipate fire weather, understand how assets respond to changing conditions and protect infrastructure from environmental stress. It also helps them correlate environmental factors with asset behavior, enabling predictive maintenance, reducing downtime, improving reliability and reducing operational costs. Our anemometers and compact weather stations are built for harsh environments. With no moving parts, they are simple to install and need very little maintenance, which makes them ideal for remote or hard-to-reach sites.

For BESS applications, Grid Solutions provides end-to-end optimization and control, executing charge and discharge operations while strictly respecting real-world customer constraints such as contracted demand limits, state-of-charge requirements, reverse power flow restrictions, and market rules. These solutions are commercially deployed today, supporting practical Virtual Power Plant (VPP) and flexibility programs. Building on this proven foundation, Grid Solutions extends its technology to data center environments, where direct control is often neither feasible nor desirable. In this context, Grid Solutions does not replace DCIM, BMS, or IT orchestration systems. Instead, our software acts as a decision-making layer that determines whether, when, and under what conditions flexibility can be used\u2014without compromising SLAs, future expansion, or regulatory compliance. By clearly separating execution and decision layers, Grid Solutions enables both customer-side batteries and data centers to contribute flexibility safely and predictably. As power systems become increasingly constrained, Grid Solutions provides the intelligence required to align operational execution with grid, market, and decarbonization objectives.

The key challenge we\u2019re addressing with GridSeer is the difficulty of integrating distributed energy resources for optimized performance. These resources range from wind, solar and batteries in grid applications, to boilers, chillers, steam generators and thermal storage for campus heating and cooling applications and even EV network design for optimized charging and discharging of vehicle batteries. While crucial for a secure energy future, these resources are variable and unpredictable, making it hard for providers and users to optimally balance supply and demand. As energy demand grows, especially as energy assets move more and more to the edge of the grid, the need for smarter energy management tools becomes critical to avoid higher risks, costs, and reduced reliability. GridSeer uses probabilistic forecasting and risk awareness to go beyond traditional energy system models. Instead of preparing for the \"most likely\" future scenario, our software evaluates all possibilities, enabling energy providers and users to make smarter, more cost-effective decisions for real-time energy resource deployment. GridSeer isn\u2019t just a forecasting tool\u2014it\u2019s a decision-making platform. Using machine learning tools, GridSeer analyzes historical and real-time data from energy meters, energy assets and weather patterns. GridSeer predicts load and demand fluctuations and recommends adjustments to optimize the energy system while also reducing reliance on costly backup power.

The hardware, the Hybrid Intelligent Transformer (HIT) innovates upon fundamental electrical building blocks, transformers, turning them into all-in-one smart devices. Coupled with IONATE\u2019s AI-enabled software, this technology transforms rigid, old power systems into smart, flexible, inherently efficient platforms. The hardware The Hybrid Intelligent Transformer (HIT) does what solid-state transformers promised: it detects, analyses and resolves power disturbances in real time. It controls voltage with sub-millisecond precision, suppresses both voltage and current harmonics and achieves full four-quadrant reactive power control. The HIT does this all in one device that maintains >99% efficiency, the footprint and reliability of a transformer. This boost operational safety and efficiency in grids, power generation, and data centers alike. The software By managing and cleaning power inside the transformer itself, each HIT lights up a real-time control node in systems that used to be passive and dark. Coordinated by IONATE\u2019s Aurora, their network will unlock a step change in efficiency, renewables hosting capacity, and achieve true smart grid capabilities with AI-enabled control. A grid with IONATE\u2019s technology and no other changes can have 33% more Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) safely 25% more power through the existing poles and wires, deferring capital upgrades 6% lower losses. This year, IONATE\u2019s technology will be deployed in Portugal and Spain with energy giant EDP, followed by a solar installation in Austria with Wiener Netze, as well as data center and C&I projects in the US.

Booths Ground Level \u2014 6209 Mark As Visited Company Information www.kevala.com About Kevala, Inc.  The Kevala platform combines the largest, most valuable, and comprehensive energy data repository with differentiated analytics capabilities to solve the world\u2019s most complex energy challenges, accelerating the transition to a clean energy future. Our cutting-edge solutions support utilities, regulators, developers, and investors in making data-driven decisions that optimize grid reliability, resilience, and long-term costs. Our Core Solutions Electrification Impact Studies - Analyze how widespread electrification affect the distribution and transmission grid. We provide essential insights to utilities, regulators, and stakeholders, enabling them to proactively plan for infrastructure upgrades, maintain reliability, and accurately forecast cost impacts, thereby ensuring a smooth, sustainable transition to widespread electrification. Our models quantify the spatial and temporal impacts of projected adoption scenarios, giving a clear roadmap for necessary investments. Integrated Grid Planning (IGP) - Built specifically for the new paradigm of distribution grid planning, Kevala\u2019s IGP suite addresses the complex and intertwined challenges of the evolving energy landscape. This includes managing the increasing penetration of DERs like rooftop solar and battery storage, supporting the electrification of transportation and building loads, and meeting the non-negotiable need for enhanced grid reliability and resilience against extreme weather events and other disruptions. Our platform facilitates least-cost planning by evaluating traditional infrastructure investments alongside non-wires alternatives (NWAs). Production Cost Modeling (PCM) - Utilities require robust, data-driven decision-making tools to plan effectively for future demand fluctuations, major infrastructure investments, and evolving energy policy changes. Our PCM offering empowers utilities to conduct highly accurate simulations and analyses, leading to informed planning decisions that optimize long-term operational costs, ensure grid stability, and meet regulatory requirements. This capability is crucial for resource adequacy and long-term financial health. Predictive Interconnection Siting Metrics (PrISM) - Slow and complex interconnection processes are a significant barrier to the rapid deployment of clean energy and electrification projects. Our PrISM offering dramatically improves this process by providing developers and utilities with high-resolution, predictive metrics on potential grid impacts and likely costs and timelines. This allows both parties to make informed siting choices upfront, significantly reducing soft costs, accelerating project development, and streamlining the overall interconnection queue process, unlocking clean energy capacity. Project Siting - Streamline and optimize the development and financing of new solar, storage, and large load projects. By providing comprehensive, location-specific insights into transmission, sub-transmission, and distribution network capacity, constraints, and upgrade costs, our Project Siting offering enables developers and investors to efficiently evaluate potential sites. This reduces financial risk, accelerates project timelines from months to weeks, and ensures that capital is deployed where it can have the greatest impact on decarbonization and grid needs. Kevala empowers organizations to navigate the complexities of the modern energy transition, make informed decisions, optimize investments, and accelerate the essential shift to a clean energy future.

    "full_description": "Feb. 3- 5 San Diego, CA Home Floor Plan Exhibitor Collateral Megajoule Plus Systems (MPS) Booths Upper Level \u2014 SU-3B Mark As Visited About Megajoule Plus Systems (MPS)  MPS utilizes capacitor storage devices that minimize or even eliminate the reliance on batteries for backup power. The core of the MPS technology lies in its innovative use of capacitor storage devices. These devices can store and deliver large amounts of energy efficiently at many voltage levels simultaneously. MPS operates with an efficiency rate of 92%, transforming megajoules of energy from a high-voltage capacitor bank into multiple useful power levels currently not available in the market. Unlike traditional DC-DC topographies, MPS features a supervisory control system that transforms pulse-power capacitor-based stacked voltage into service voltage, compensating for the asymptotic capacitive voltage swings. Further, MPS can deliver large amounts of energy from the high voltage storage side to a load-driver linear service voltage. An integrated and innovative multi-filar inductor accommodates large currents. In addition, MPS features a unique switching process while recharging. In other words, MPS can deliver large amounts of energy from its high voltage side to drive multiple lower service-level voltage loads in a steady-state mode. Therefore, MPS allows the smooth and efficient transfer of high levels of energy from a capacitor bank to multiple loads with multiple voltages. It is a direct DC to DC voltage converter. MPS is superior than batteries for the following reasons. Batteries have a relatively flat discharge voltage; however, they are low voltage devices (around 1.5 volts per cell) unless one must connect many of them in series. Moreover, batteries have their environmental challenges. By contrast capacitors are lighter and today, power capacitors have the capacity of one to ten megajoules. But for capacitors, the discharge curve drops to 50% by only discharging 75% of its energy. That is why power capacitors can only be used as direct discharge systems for short bursts of energy.

As DERs scale rapidly across the grid, utilities are discovering that participation alone does not equal performance. Traditional Virtual Power Plants (VPPs have largely focused on enrollment, scheduling, and market access\u2014issuing signals and hoping assets respond. That approach works for participation, but it breaks down when reliability, verification, and operational trust become the bar. Molecule was built to address the missing layer: deterministic, on-site execution. Molecule is an edge-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service platform that operates behind the meter, where devices physically live and where control can actually be enforced. Rather than acting as a centralized scheduler in the cloud, Molecule functions as the local execution environment that translates grid intent into real, verifiable behavior across batteries, EV chargers, solar, and other flexible loads. This distinction matters. Cloud-based VPP platforms and aggregators can coordinate schedules, but they rely on APIs, OEM logic, and best-effort connectivity for execution. Molecule embeds directly at the site or gateway level, enabling real-time orchestration, fallback logic, and device-level authority even under stressed grid conditions. The result is predictable response, five-minute telemetry, and performance verification during events\u2014not hours later. Think of the difference as the gap between planning and operations. Many VPPs act as planners, deciding what should happen. Molecule acts as the on-site operator, ensuring it actually does happen. Molecule\u2019s platform is designed as long-lived infrastructure, not fixed-function software. Utilities invest over 15\u201320 year horizons, while markets, programs, and operating requirements change far faster. Molecule\u2019s execution layer is continuously updatable, allowing utilities and partners to adapt dispatch logic, orchestration strategies, and control policies over time without stranding physical assets. For utilities, Molecule enables DERs to behave less like probabilistic resources and more like dispatchable infrastructure\u2014supporting higher control maturity, reduced operational risk, and confidence in real-world performance. For OEMs, Molecule provides a way to make hardware grid-ready without building and maintaining complex control software in-house. For investors, Molecule represents the foundational execution layer that the distributed grid has been missing\u2014turning intelligence and forecasts into measurable, reliable outcomes. Molecule\u2019s mission is simple: close the execution gap so VPPs can earn the same operational trust as traditional grid resources.

(White labeled VPP platform one pager)  BROCHURE  Molecule OEM Platform Overview Deck Contact Us  Adam Boucher  CEO  Adam Boucher is a Founder and the CEO of Molecule Systems, an edge-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service platform built to make distributed energy resources operate with the reliability and predictability utilities expect from traditional grid assets.  Adam has spent over a decade in commercial energy project development, followed by the last eight years focused on software, controls, and grid integration. Working closely with utilities, OEMs, and developers, he repeatedly encountered the same challenge: while DERs were scaling rapidly, the software coordinating them was optimized for enrollment and scheduling, not deterministic execution.  He co-founded Molecule to close that execution gap.  At the core of Molecule is an edge-based operating system, originally derived from aerospace applications, designed for high reliability, continuous operation, and long service lifecycles. Running on-site and fully interoperable across devices and protocols, Molecule\u2019s execution layer translates grid intent into real, verifiable behavior\u2014enabling DERs to respond like infrastructure rather than best-effort resources.  As CEO, Adam leads product strategy, go-to-market execution, partnerships, and fundraising, with a focus on product-market fit and operational credibility. His work is guided by a simple belief: the distributed grid will only scale when DERs can be controlled, verified, and trusted in the same way as traditional generation.

It goes beyond visualization, capturing real-world spatial relationships \u2014 and how they change in any condition \u2014 that are essential to answering any \u2018what-if\u2019 question about your network: \u2022 Between assets and their surroundings \u2014 in a >50 mph SW wind scenario, where will assets breach safe clearance thresholds? \u2022 Between assets themselves \u2014 if one pole fails, which other ones will go with it? \u2022 Across layers of workflows \u2014 if a tower gets moved inland, how will vegetation encroachment zones shift? It applies the same physics-verified rigor used in engineering design to the full set of critical infrastructure challenges \u2014 from asset management and wildfire mitigation to resiliency and reliability, and design and construction. It connects the granular perspective engineers need to maintain a structurally sound, safe system with the network-wide view leaders need to improve reliability and efficiency. With Neara, daily realities upgrade from: \u2022 Chasing risks by problem area to prioritizing context-agnostic risks by total network impact \u2022 Costly and inefficient manual processes to precise, automated workflows \u2022 Messy, anecdotal, project justification to easy-to-audit business cases that hold up from the field to the boardroom and courtroom Every analysis, from a single pole\u2019s loading to a proposed new transmission route, is grounded in the same structural ground truth so infrastructure owners can prioritize and validate network investment to maximize impact and capital efficiency in every context on every timescale. Trusted by global utilities including Southern California Edison, CenterPoint Energy, HEDNO, and ESB, Neara has modeled millions of assets across four continents \u2014 reducing key processes from years to hours, restoring service >3\u00d7 faster, and saving tens of millions in annual costs.

As the world\u2019s leading nuclear supplier for online condenser tube cleaning systems and debris filters, our technologies protect assets, recover efficiency, and ensure stable operation across the globe. On Line Condenser Tube Cleaning Systems (CTCS) Invented by TAPROGGE and trusted worldwide, our CTCS\u2019 keeps surface condensers, heat exchangers, and chillers at peak performance by continuously removing micro-fouling without taking the unit offline. A steady circulation of sponge rubber cleaning balls maintains tube cleanliness, restores heat transfer efficiency, and prevents the performance drift that increases fuel consumption, emissions, and operating costs. KLAREN Technology for Vertical Heat Exchangers & Evaporators For vertical, forced circulation equipment, our KLAREN self cleaning system uses recirculating metallic cleaning particles to prevent fouling at the tube surface. The result: Higher heat-transfer coefficients, longer run times, and stable production, even in challenging, high solids or high salinity environments. High Performance Debris Filter Systems: Protection Against Macro Fouling Placed directly upstream of the condenser or heat exchanger, TAPROGGE debris filters stop macro debris (leaves, shells, plastics, seasonal events, etc.) from entering the cooling circuit. By preventing tube blockage, erosion-corrosion, and turbine backpressure rise, our systems deliver greater reliability and measurable MW recovery for both coastal and inland plants. Data Centers: Efficiency at Scale for improved PUE stability For large water cooled data centers, condenser and evaporator cleanliness is directly tied to electrical load and energy cost. TAPROGGE\u2019s cleaning technologies help facilities maintain maximum chiller performance, achieving significant energy savings, reduced downtime. Industries served: Power, nuclear, chemical, petrochemical, desalination, water treatment, Geothermal, and general industry.  About Taprogge America Corporation Product Categories Energy Trading/ Energy Markets > Optimization Contact Us  Jose Fernandez  Sales Manager Latin America  For decades, TAPROGGE has been a trusted partner in protecting condensers, intakes, and cooling systems worldwide.\u00a0  In my role with TAPROGGE America Corp., I help Utilities, EPCs, OEMs, and industrial operators worldwide apply technologies like Condenser Tube Cleaning Systems (CTCS), High-Performance Debris Filters, and Self-Cleaning Vertical Heat Exchangers to address their efficiency and availability challenges.  These solutions don\u2019t just maintain reliability. They deliver measurable ROI by reducing fuel costs, improving efficiency, extending plant life, and aligning with regulatory and Net-Zero objectives!  My focus spans nuclear, fossil, desalination, geothermal, and now the rapidly growing SMR and data center cooling markets.\u00a0  Whether it\u2019s helping a NPP recover lost MW's due to fouling, a Caribbean utility mitigate debris intake risks, supporting a Latin American EPC on efficiency projects, or advising U.S. operators on SMR readiness, connecting clients with systems that transform operational challenges into long term value is what drives me.\u00a0  If you\u2019re working to reduce costs, boost efficiency, or improve reliability in your energy or water infrastructure, let\u2019s connect.

    "full_description": "Feb. 3- 5 San Diego, CA Home Floor Plan Exhibitor Collateral Terminus Industrials Booths Upper Level \u2014 UL350 Mark As Visited About Terminus Industrials  Terminus Industrials is an industrial energy and advanced manufacturing company focused on accelerating domestic production of critical power infrastructure, beginning with large power transformers (LPTs). The company was formed in response to growing grid reliability risks driven by aging transformer fleets, extended replacement timelines, and heavy reliance on foreign manufacturing. Large power transformers are the physical choke points of the electric grid. They are custom-built, slow to replace, and essential to every major generator, transmission system, and industrial load. Today, utilities and developers face lead times that often exceed five years, while demand continues to rise from electrification, data centers, and grid modernization. These constraints create operational, economic, and national security risks. Terminus Industrials is building a new production model designed to address these challenges directly. The company is developing modular, design-for-manufacturability transformer systems supported by automated production methods, vertically integrated supply chains, and digitally native manufacturing infrastructure. By rethinking how transformers are designed, engineered, and produced, Terminus aims to dramatically compress engineering cycles and production timelines while maintaining utility-grade performance and compliance. A key differentiator for Terminus is its systems-level execution approach. Engineering, manufacturing, logistics, and operations are integrated into a unified delivery model rather than treated as separate silos. This reduces coordination risk, improves predictability, and enables repeatable, scalable production. Terminus also emphasizes domestic sourcing and in-house warehousing of critical materials to reduce exposure to supply chain disruption. Terminus Industrials serves customers across the POWERGEN ecosystem, including utilities, private developers, industrial operators, and federal partners. Early commercial engagement includes projects where speed, reliability, and execution certainty are critical, while the company works toward long-term utility qualification and scaled domestic capacity. The leadership team brings experience from advanced manufacturing, energy infrastructure, digital systems, and large-scale facility deployment. This informs a practical, execution-driven culture focused on reliability, safety, and lifecycle value rather than experimental technology. At POWERGEN, Terminus Industrials engages with industry stakeholders to discuss how accelerated, domestic production of large power transformers can strengthen grid resilience, support load growth, and reduce long-term infrastructure risk.

    "full_description": "Feb. 3- 5 San Diego, CA Home Floor Plan Exhibitor Collateral Electron Booths Upper Level \u2014 UL811 Mark As Visited Company Information www.electron.net About Electron  ABOUT ELECTRON: Electron\u2019s mission is to unlock energy abundance by helping utilities deliver affordable, reliable grid capacity from millions of flexible distributed energy resources (DERs). Combining grid-aware analytics with market coordination to deliver value orchestration, Electron enables system operators and utilities to uncover, validate, and activate the value of distributed flexibility. Trusted by leading utilities worldwide, Electron is providing the digital foundations for a proof-led, low-cost, and resilient energy system. WHY ELECTRON? Electron\u2019s technology strengthens, rather than replaces, existing market and control-system tools and teams. It connects DERMS, VPPs, trading platforms, and utility programs through a neutral coordination layer that standardises data exchange, enhances visibility, and removes the need for spreadsheets and manual processes. By linking these previously siloed systems, Electron helps the whole ecosystem deliver flexibility faster, more securely, and at lower cost. Key benefits include: 1) Faster, lower-cost deployment Utilities can identify and deploy flexibility within weeks, not years, unlocking network headroom without waiting for physical reinforcement. Delivered through a SaaS model, the platform can be deployed rapidly without heavy IT integration. The Grid Analytics capability can analyse millions of AMI meters-worth of utility data securely and efficiently (typically 2-4 weeks vs. 6-12mths), using existing datasets to produce actionable insights without direct access to operational systems-maintaining strong data-security boundaries. Likewise, the Flexibility Marketplace streamlines how utilities and VPPs interact, providing a neutral layer to transact market data whilst creating a secure airgap between participants. Together, this pragmatic approach to grid and market data dramatically reduces time to value for utilities and VPPs. 2) Solving the buy-side scaling problem The challenge today isn\u2019t finding flexible assets - it\u2019s enabling utilities to value and trust them. Electron combines grid analytics and market performance data to generate regulatory-grade, auditable evidence of flexibility\u2019s cost-effectiveness. This gives utilities and regulators confidence to invest, plan, and report on flexibility as a dependable alternative to reinforcement, or indeed to justify why proactive grid upgrades were needed. 3) Grid-aware market coordination ElectronConnect enables multiple concurrent market products, coordinating dispatch to avoid overlaps and ensure flexibility only activates where it benefits the grid whilst avoiding double counting. 4) Ecosystem enablement and innovation Through open APIs and shared data standards, Electron provides a trusted platform on which others-utilities, aggregators, and third-party innovators-can build new services and value streams. This common foundation supports ongoing innovation and affordability while scaling the flexibility needed to flatten the duck curve.

Its purpose is to demonstrate\u2014clearly and credibly\u2014that Software-Defined Automation for substations is deployable today, using implemented, utility-validated solutions rather than conceptual demonstrations or future promises. At the center of the booth experience are two production-proven \u201csolutions in a box,\u201d grounded in real deployments from leading utilities and supported by an open, multi-vendor ecosystem. These implementations illustrate how compute, networking, and analytics come together to form a scalable, standards-based architecture\u2014aligned with real-world utility requirements including cybersecurity, interoperability, lifecycle management, and operational reliability. Rather than product pitches, the booth is structured around live, peer-to-peer dialogue with utility leaders. Attendees engage directly with utilities operating vPAC-based architectures, enabling informed discussion around deployment realities, lessons learned, and realistic adoption paths based on production use rather than prototypes. Design & Experience The booth design emphasizes clarity, trust, and approachability through a clean, modern aesthetic and consistent visual language. Open sightlines, minimal clutter, and intentional lighting create an inviting environment that encourages longer engagement and conversation. Large-format architectural visuals and restrained messaging reinforce system-level thinking over component-level promotion. Sponsor recognition is integrated thoughtfully, strengthening credibility without overwhelming visitors. The result is a space positioned not to browse products, but to learn, validate, and discuss real-world solutions with peers. Engagement & Programming: A Key Differentiator The booth hosts live, moderated dialogue sessions throughout the event, featuring utilities\u2014including Salt River Project (SRP) and Southern California Edison (SCE)\u2014alongside OEMs and technology partners. Sessions focus on: Deployments happening now Lessons learned from implementation Incremental, realistic adoption strategies Coffee-served sessions increase dwell time and encourage repeat visits, transforming the booth into a destination for substantive, utility-driven conversation rather than a stop for passive viewing. Solution Readiness & Credibility A consistent message anchors the entire booth experience: These solutions are available for deployment today. Visitors have the opportunity to engage directly with utilities operating live vPAC-based systems, reinforcing trust, credibility, and practical relevance. The booth demonstrates how software-defined approaches modernize substation architectures without disrupting existing operations\u2014enabling utilities to adopt new capabilities at a pace aligned with operational realities. Collaboration & Industry Impact The vPAC Alliance booth reflects true ecosystem collaboration, with shared ownership of dialogue sessions, demonstrations, and content across utilities, OEMs, and technology providers. All sessions are recorded and amplified through social media and post-event content, extending impact beyond the show floor and building momentum for continued engagement throughout 2026. The result is not just an exhibit\u2014but a working model for how utilities and industry partners collaborate today to modernize grid infrastructure.
